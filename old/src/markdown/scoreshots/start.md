I began working on the ScoreShots product after the departure of the previous Lead Developer. The product was design finalized, but work had barely begun. I hit the ground running, taking the design spec, improving upon it where necessary, and throwing together a minimum viable product in just under four months. This is noteworthy for a few reasons, one of which being that most of the core decisions that were made here on systems architecture remain in place today.
