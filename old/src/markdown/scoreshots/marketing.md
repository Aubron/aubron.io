Following the overwhelmingly positive response to Next at CoSIDA, I revamped our marketing efforts to allow us to do more with a small staff. I integrated us deeply with Intercom for communication and Stripe for payment processing, using Stripe for all of our invoicing and allowing customer service reps to see Stripe subscription information.

I automated the client check-in and renewal emails through Intercom, freeing up a huge amount of time in our marketing department to handle the influx of new leads and clients.
