I wireframed, and then mocked, a UI overhaul, and presented it to the team. After a couple of rounds of revisions, I got the green light to move forward, building upon the existing php and Codeigniter based API with a much more modern look.

I chose the (then brand-new) Material Design standards from Google, and implemented them into the product to provide a modern, consistent UI. This platform overhaul,  would form the foundation of the product until mid-2018, and was transformative to its look and feel.
