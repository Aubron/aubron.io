          Following the overwhelmingly positive response to Next at CoSIDA, I revamped our
          marketing efforts to allow us to do more with a small staff. I integrated us
          deeply with Intercom for communication and Stripe for payment processing,
          using Stripe for all of our invoicing and allowing customer service reps
          to see Stripe subscription information.

          I automated customer check-ins and renewal emails through Intercom, freeing up a
          huge amount of time in our marketing department to handle the influx of new leads
          and clients.

          I spent almost a year working solo, mostly during nights and weekends, to do a final
          revamp of the platform. At the annual CoSIDA event, I deployed ScoreShots Next to our clients
          via a custom opt-in system, pulling their old data into a new GraphQL database. Reactions have
          been overwhelmingly positive, and it has driven sales numbers higher than ever before in the
          product's lifetime.

            I built Next on a React and GraphQL technology stack that allows for a responsive,
            lightning fast interface. Scaling from iPhone X to Retina display Macbooks, Next looks
            and works fantastically regardless of the size of your screen.

            Next's production infrastructure is fully AWS driven. Our GraphQL resolvers run on
            lambda, querying a prisma.io layer that is backed by Aurora. The static site content is
            served via S3 and a Cloudfront distribution, and various EC2/ECS-based microservices
            handle things like image resizing and video generation.

            The master branch is continuously deployed and tested by Codeship. Everything from

            master branch commit, verifying against jest tests and the airbnb eslint preset.

          I designed and implemented an automated video rendering pipeline running in AWS Lambda, which
          used fabric.js to allow the client to add, scale, and position assets, and then fed those assets
          into ffmpeg, which created both graphics with video backgrounds, and allowed for motion effects like
          panzooms and fades on image content.

          With the MVP in the hands of a few early clients, I was able to overhaul the software's (at this point abysmal) UI.
          I adopted the brand-new Material Design standards from Google, and customized them to create a unique feel for

          Despite my many protests on design and layout, I created the MVP to spec, changing only that which was truly egregious.

          I began working on the ScoreShots product after the departure of the previous Lead Developer. I was handed the product spec and told
          it was already a month behind, and got to work. I would eventually end up restructuring the development team and mostly starting over with the
          Codeigniter MVC framework, due to systemic and architectural issues.
