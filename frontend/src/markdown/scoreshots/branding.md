With a new product launch approaching, I pitched and coordinated a full rebrand. We threw off the tired color scheme, slogan and logo for a modern, creative look. This look would propagate through our marketing materials, trade show appearances, and online presence. I would also completely redo the ScoreShots.com homepage, moving to a minimal, demo focused flow that would later include automated ordering.

I also made the above promotional video in After Effects.

_Meet your new MVP._
