#### About ScoreShots
This has been my passion project for several years. The general idea was to allow sports teams to create beautiful social media images and videos via a canvas and template based approach. It has an intuitive editor, sports-centric features like statistics imports, image filters and editing tools, all within a browser. It also has its own built-in sharing and scheduling platform to Facebook and Twitter, as well as a whole suite of motion graphics features.

**ScoreShots has taught me so much about the startup process**. I've handled our production and development environments, moved our entire infrastructure to AWS in the process. I wrote our business plan, twice, and have presented with passion in front of rooms of investors as well as conventions filled with clients and potential clients. I've done market research, automated marketing acquisition flows, handled support infrastructure, and had the unique opportunity to build a client success team from scratch.

At present, the product powers the social media of hundreds of sports teams across all sports and sizes, ranging from high schools to *professional teams like the Dallas Mavericks*, and I'm very proud of how far it's come. I consider my drive to go **above and beyond** a huge contributing factor in the product's success, so below I've laid out some milestones in the product's history, and my role for those stages of the startup process.
